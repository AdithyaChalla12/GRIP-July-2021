Data Science Internship Readme
Overview
During my data science internship, I conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on several datasets, employed various visualization techniques, and applied machine learning algorithms for prediction and clustering tasks. Below is a summary of the projects and methodologies used.

Projects
1.  Exploratory Data Analysis(IPL Data Set)
Objective: To analyze the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset to uncover insights about matches, teams, players, and overall trends.
Techniques Used:
Heat Maps: To visualize the correlation between different features.
Histograms: To understand the distribution of numerical data like runs scored, wickets taken, etc.
Bar Graphs: To compare categorical data such as team performance, top players, etc.
Line Charts: To observe trends over seasons and matches.
Pie Charts: To show the proportion of wins by different teams.
2. Global Terrorism Dataset Analysis
Objective: To perform an in-depth analysis of global terrorism incidents to identify patterns and trends.
Techniques Used:
Heat Maps: To identify regions with high terrorism activity.
Histograms: To analyze the frequency of incidents over the years.
Bar Graphs: To compare types of attacks, target types, and terrorist groups.
Line Charts: To visualize trends over time.
Pie Charts: To represent the proportion of different types of attacks or targets.
3. Retail Store Dataset Analysis
Objective: To analyze retail store data to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management.
Techniques Used:
Heat Maps: To show the correlation between different sales and inventory features.
Histograms: To understand the distribution of sales data.
Bar Graphs: To compare sales performance across different stores, products, and time periods.
Line Charts: To track sales trends over time.
Pie Charts: To display the market share of different product categories.
4. Linear Regression for Score Prediction
Objective: To predict the user score based on the number of hours studied per day using Linear Regression.
Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Feature Selection: Identifying the relevant features for the model.
Model Training: Using Linear Regression to train the model on the dataset.
Prediction: Predicting user scores for different study hours and evaluating model performance.
5. K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset
Objective: To utilize K-means clustering for unsupervised learning to cluster the Iris dataset into different groups based on their features.
Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the dataset.
Feature Selection: Choosing the relevant features for clustering.
Clustering: Applying K-means clustering to partition the data into clusters.
Visualization: Using scatter plots to visualize the clusters and analyze the results.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Conclusion
This internship provided valuable hands-on experience with data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques. The projects completed demonstrate a strong ability to extract insights from data, predict future outcomes, and cluster data into meaningful groups. This experience has further enhanced my skills and prepared me for more advanced data science challenges.
